# Task Management System

## Overview
The Task Management System is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React with Vite, and Node.js) application designed to allow users to create, view, update, and delete tasks with specific restrictions and role-based access control. The system ensures a user-friendly and secure task management experience.

## Features
- Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
- Tasks include title, description, priority, and due date.
- Users can mark tasks as completed.
- Filter tasks by priority and/or due date.
- Only admin/validators can delete tasks.
- Tasks cannot be created on public holidays.
- Undo functionality for changes.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.

## Tech Stack
### Backend:
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** (RESTful API)
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** (Database)
- **JWT Authentication** for security
- **Role-based access control**

### Frontend:
- **React** with **Vite**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### DevOps & Deployment:
- Docker for containerization
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Cloud deployment options (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version)
- MongoDB (Local or Atlas)
- Docker (Optional, for containerization)

### Backend Setup
```sh
